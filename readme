Notes & options

Security & privacy: This demo adds basic validation, prepared statements, and rate limiting. For production, add a privacy policy page and CSRF defense if you enable non-JSON forms.

Hosting: Place server.js on a small Node host (Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.) and point a domain to it. Use managed MySQL (PlanetScale, RDS, etc.).

Analytics: You can later add anonymized analytics (e.g., Plausible) to measure conversion.

Customization: Change branding (logo, colors, copy) in index.html and tune the statistics text for your region/market.
